    <p class="description">
      This project, while closed source, was by-and-large the highlight of my time consulting for Cargill.  They were on their journey towards public-cloud adoption and were making great strides.  An infrastructure team had been spun up to build <strong>Captain</strong> Cargill's development teams to define all of their deployments to AWS as code using a syntax fairly similar to Kubernetes manifest files.  But there was one problem; due to networking constraints, not all workloads could go to AWS.  For on-prem workloads, there was no deployment-as-code solution requiring engineers to learn a nuanced web interface for configuring VMs, and then navigate it everytime a new workload was needed.  In a few weeks, with some of the amazing engineers at Cargill, I released <strong>Gilligan</strong>, a ruby-based CI/ CD plugin that served as a counterpart to the existing Captain solution.

      An up-coming kickstarter project for a device with a react/ capacitor-based frontend for web/ mobile interactions, two embedded python services, and an ARM Cortex-A based device running those two services on linux.  I really enjoyed building out the infrastructure related to this project.  I learned a lot about AWS and their IPV6 support that can allow for some very economical networking solutions.  This project is currently closed source while I source financing for the marketing aspects of the campaign, but I'm hopeful it makes traction and forms a strong community in the automation space.

It showcases professional use of rails, caching, and SQL optimations and has a dandy frontend that I didn't design myself but really admire.  I was sure to do everything possible to ensure the app was performant and able to out-deliver competing frameworks sometimes presumed to be faster.
