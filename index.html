<h4>Best Software Works</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Driver: <a href="https://github.com/TheNotary/keyboard_driver_sk80">A Keyboard Driver</a> for the lights on my keyboard along with an accompanying <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheNotary/ce7844f9333bca7fafcc7409ca6d657b">article</a> documenting the reverse engineering techniques I used throughout the process</li>
  <li> Gadget: An up-coming (?) kickstarter project composed of a react/ capacitor-based frontend for web/mobile interactions, two python services, and an ARM Cortex-A based embedded device running those two services on linux.  This project is currently closed source while I source financing for the marketing aspects of the campaign.</li>
  <li> Game: <a href="https://github.com/TriNetCo/pax-imperia-clone">Pax Imperia </a> A collaborative effort where myself and three collegues set out to re-create Pax Imperia in web technologies.  We used Javascript, Go, and a tiny bit of React to build the multiplayer experience.</li>
  <li> Game: <a href="https://github.com/TheNotary/initial_fantasy">Initial Fantasy</a></li>
  <li> Game: <a href="https://thenotary.github.io/fish_poop/keyboard_memory/index.html">Mario Teaches Typing</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Less interesting Software I've Built</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Networking: <a href="https://github.com/TheNotary/cshrp_websocket_edu">C# Websocket Implementation</a></li>
  <li> Interesting Frontend: <a href="  https://github.com/TheNotary/edu-offline-webapp-demo">A Frameworkless, Offline, DB Syncronizing Web App</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Cool Things I Started that I Need to Find Time to Finish</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Device: <a href="https://github.com/TheNotary/arduino-linux_server_status_display/tree/master">An Amtel-based network-attached LCD Screen</a>.  I apparently lost the source for this but here's an edu depo I did which used all the components.  TODO: Recreate the original Network Attached LCD source code, I've checked everywhere.</li>
  <li> Text Game: <a href="https://github.com/TheNotary/adventure_channel">Adventure Channel</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Development Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/TheNotary/notes">Notes</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/TheNotary/mac_windows_linux_loadouts">mac_windows_linux_loadouts</a></li>  
  <li><a href="https://github.com/TheNotary/sensor_array">Sensor Array</a>A rails app that is nothing but my notes on working with electronics</li>  
</ul>
