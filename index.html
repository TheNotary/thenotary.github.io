            I led the release of this Ruby-based CI/ CD plugin while consulting at Cargill.  This project, was by-and-large the highlight of my time consulting for Cargill.  The client was on their journey towards public-cloud adoption and were making great strides.  An infrastructure team had been spun up to build <strong>Captain</strong> which enabled the enterprise's development teams to define all of their deployments to AWS as code using a syntax fairly similar to Kubernetes manifest files.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there was one problem; due to networking constraints, not all workloads could actually go to AWS.  For on-prem workloads, there was no deployment-as-code solution requiring engineers to learn a nuanced web interface for configuring VMs, and then navigate it everytime a new workload was needed.  After a few weeks of development and with help from some of the amazing engineers at Cargill, I released <strong>Gilligan</strong>, a Ruby-based CI/ CD plugin that served as an on-prem counterpart to the existing Captain solution.

This project is currently closed source while I source financing for the marketing aspects of the campaign, but I'm hopeful it makes traction and forms a strong community in the automation space.

Due to cloud costs, the backend is no longer available, but don't let that stop you from checking out the <a href="https://pax.njax.org/" target="_">demo</a>.

            While between contracting clients and wanting to both brush up on my C# and also study websockets, I decided to spend a week writing a C# library based on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455">RFC 6455</a> that uses nothing but TCP sockets as a basis.  It was fun pouring over the RFC whitepaper and piecing the protocol together in C# and also gave me that implementation practice in C# I hadn't been getting enough of over the past few years.  The library was eventually packaged for consumption via Unity.  I used the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/events/observer-design-pattern">Observer design pattern</a> to implement a pub/ sub functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Writing well tested code is important to me, it relieves me of the doubt and concern that otherwise comes hand-in-hand with code changes.  The satisfactory test coverage in this project is owed to my use of the <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter/csharp/example">Adapter Pattern</a> which allows me to use real NetworkStreams in my production code, and switch to a mocked out implementation when running my tests.

          I worked with a lot of different technologies at Optum.  I developed Rest APIs using Java Spring Boot, defined infrastructure as code using Ansible influenced idempotent provisioners, defined deployments to Openshift and Kubernetes via k8s manifest files, managed a Kafka services used by multiple teams, built CI/ CD pipelines to manage deployments,  contributed to the design and implementation of the enterprise's centralized CI/ CD pipeline library, did cloud engineering "stuff" with AWS and terraform, and did miscellaneous data engineering "stuff" with Hadoop, HIVE, HBase, Flink, Kafka consumers/ produces (in Java), and Pyspark.

        <!--
          I don't know how to present this, but for my own sake, the project names I can recall are:
          * Cloud Center of Excelence: Cloud and infrastructure providing team.
          * BIAS: BI as a Service - I stood up a kafka cluster and managed it.  I picked up Java and did some stuff with it???  I don't actually remember doing any Java stories, lol... oh yeah, I was brought in as the Devops guy.  I picked up all the CI/ CD work for the team.  I did the deployments, I think I must have learned Redhat's Openshift followed by kubernetes?  I managed the k8s deployments.
          * Change Data Capture: Some proprietary service to capture database changes and send them to our event streams.
          * Polaris: I think I did a Java Spring Boot API that interfaced with some external team, but the external team wasn't ready to start working so we switched gears to something else?
          * ____: Some project that was going to replace a 3rd party licensed software parsing EDI data that cost over $1 million dollars per month to use.
          * JPAC: Jenkins Pipeline as Code team.
          * Misc Devops: I did Vault and secrets management to help teams adopt Vault and utilize it effectively.
          * Github Instructor: I led teams of students through our Github training program.
          * CCAT-DE: Data Engineering, Airflow, HIVE, HBase, Hadoop, MapR.  Airflow ran a series of HIVE queries that pulled data from HIVE and did ETL that eventually populated a table in HIVE... Then our Kafka consumer would run, and consume from our Hive table, and stream data out to Kafka.  There was also a Kafka consumer that pulled the data out of Kafka and I think populated a MySQL database for the CCAT frontend team.

          This was a customer-facing Rails app that helped our customers navigate their healthcare needs.  You know you're in healthcare when the application you inherit is too complicated to boot locally into a presentable state.  Our deployments were split across the on-prem data center furnished by our sponsor in Healthcare and AWS.  We had an amazing architect who set up all our AWS infrastructure as code using Terraform.

          EFF Fab was paid work I did for the EFF who actually do open source projects! It showcases professional use of Rails, caching, and SQL optimizations.  This app was a replacement for an older PHP app performing the same task in a less feature rich manner.  Eager to present Rails in it's best light, I took every measure to keep it as performant as the application it was obsoleting.
