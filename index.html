      This project controls the lights on my keyboard and helped me refresh my x86 reverse engineering skills. This project includes an accompanying
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheNotary/ce7844f9333bca7fafcc7409ca6d657b">article</a>
      documenting the reverse engineering techniques I used throughout the process.  As a fun bonus, this article was commented on and republished in <a href="https://hackaday.com/">hackaday's</a> blog.

    <strong>Rails 2025, Ruby Gems, Automation + GenAI: </strong>
    <a href="#apps/j____">In a closed source</a>
    my latest Rails work should be refrenced where I use lots of great features in Rails (Stimulus, rails-turbo, Devise, ActiveJob, ActionCable, MiniTest, RSpec) as well as some interesting GenAI libraries (SpaCy, pgvector, llama-cpp-python).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>React + Capacitor + Python + ARM Embedded Gadget: </strong>
    Source is closed atm, see /maker_and_hardware/rpi/hardware-r...
    An up-coming (?) kickstarter project composed of a react/ capacitor-based frontend for web/mobile interactions, two python services, and an ARM Cortex-A based embedded device running those two services on linux.  This project is currently closed source while I source financing for the marketing aspects of the campaign.

    Closed source continuation lives on gitlab now at /games/pax-imperia-clone.
    A collaborative effort where myself and three collegues set out to re-create Pax Imperia in web technologies.  We used Javascript, Go, and a tiny bit of React to build the multiplayer experience.

  <li> Device: <a href="https://github.com/TheNotary/arduino-linux_server_status_display/tree/master">An Amtel-based network-attached LCD Screen</a>.  I apparently lost the source for this but here's an edu demo I did which used all the components.  TODO: Recreate the original Network Attached LCD source code, I've checked everywhere.</li>
